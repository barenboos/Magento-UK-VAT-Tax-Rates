Magento UK Tax Rates
====================

## Usage
Login to your Magento backend and navigate to `Sales > Tax > Import / Export Tax Rates`. Use `Export Tax Rates` to backup your previous rates. Use `Import Tax Rates` to upload the file 
`tax_rates.csv` from this repository.

Note that the first row of the CSV is in English, and you'll need the English locale to be loaded for this CSV to be imported correctly. To allow for this: Change the locale in the bottom of your Magento Admin Panel
to "English (United States)".

## Disclaimer
We took the information from various third party sites like Wikipedia. The information might be incorrect. If you have a better resource to base this CSV file off, please let us know.

This file has been tested so far on the following Magento versions:
* Magento CE 1.9
* Magento CE 1.8
